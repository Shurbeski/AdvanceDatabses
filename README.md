# AdvanceDatabses
Advance-DataBases project, I am using PostgreSQL for developing the database for TopShop!


1) The ER diagram.
2) The DDL, which includes the creating the tables and generating fake data for the database.
3) Writing some Queries that gonna serve my application.
4) I wrote 4 more queries that gonna serve my application and I did optimization by using Indexing!
5) I did the  STORED PROCEDURES AND TRIGGERS FOR MY APPLICATION
6) The web application, that is serving my database. Just open VisualStudio check the connection string again, and you can tried out.

**The point of the project was optimization. We have all of the business logic in the database, the back-end is free.
